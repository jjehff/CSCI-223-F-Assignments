Score: A

On the surface, everything looks like it's running correctly, I didn't
detect any memory leaks or errors. However, you have a slight problem
in the FreeList function...

Inside the loop you have these statements:

   free(currentNode);
   currentNode = currentNode->next;

The problem here is the order of operations. If you free currentNode,
then at that point the value of the pointer is no longer valid and
should not be used. However, you're using it in the statement that
follows when you dereference to access the 'next' member. One fix is
to use the lead/trail pointer technique, so that you can advance the
lead pointer and call the 'free' function with the trail pointer.

So you've got a slight bug to fix, but overall you've done a fine job
here, congratulations!
